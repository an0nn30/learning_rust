Don't worry, spiders,$
I keep house$
casually.$
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.$
The bustle in a house$
The morning after death$
Is solemnest of industries$
Enacted upon earth,‚M-^@M-^T$
$
The sweeping up the heart,$
And putting love away$
We shall not want to use again$
Until eternity.$
